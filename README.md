# hosting-my-personal-website-on-AWS-CloudFront

# Why this project?
This was a project to develop AWS cloud skills. I'm taking a cloud architecture class to prepare for the AWS SAA exam in December. One of the side projects to increase our class expertise was to create a personal website and host it using AWS CloudFront. This was my first hands on experience with doing an AWS project. 

# Resources
I watched several YouTube tutorials since this is widely recommended project for people interested in learning more about AWS.

# Challenges 
The main video showed me how to use a CloudFront created domain name. However, I had purchased a domain name and wanted to use that domain instead. I ran into issues configuring the bucket policies correctly
